# Computer Quiz

This is a simple Python program that quizzes users on computer-related questions.


## Code Overview

The `quiz_game.py` file contains Python code that asks users a series of computer-related questions and provides feedback on their answers.

The program starts with a welcome message and asks the user if they want to play the quiz. If the user agrees, the quiz begins. For each question, the user is prompted to input their answer. If the answer is correct, the program prints "Correct answer!" and increases the score by 1. If the answer is incorrect, the program prints "Incorrect Answer!" without modifying the score.

After answering all the questions, the program prints the user's final score.
